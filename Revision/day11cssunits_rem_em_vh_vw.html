    <h1>two categories: absolute units and relative units.</h1>
    
    <h2>Absolute Units:</h2>

<h3>Pixels (px):</h3>  Pixels are the most commonly used absolute unit in web development. They provide a fixed-size measurement, with one pixel representing one dot on the screen. Pixel units are reliable and consistent across different devices and resolutions, making them a popular choice.
<h3>Points (pt):</h3>  Points are another absolute unit commonly used in print media but less so in web development. One point is 1/72 of an inch, making it a physical measurement. However, due to the variability of screen sizes and resolutions, points are less predictable than pixels and are used less frequently in web design.
    

<h2>Relative Units:</h2>

<h3>Percentage (%):</h3>  Percentage units are relative to the parent element's size. For example, setting a width of 50% on a container div will make it half the width of its parent element. Percentages are commonly used for responsive design, allowing elements to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
<h3>Relative Lengths (em, rem):</h3>
<ul>
    <li> em: One em is equal to the font size of the current element. For example, setting a font size of 2em on a paragraph will make the text twice as large as the font size of its parent element.
    </li>
    <li>rem: One rem is equal to the font size of the root element (<html>). Rem units are useful for creating more predictable and consistent layouts, especially in large-scale projects where nesting can become complex.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Viewport Width/Height (vw/vh):</h3>
These units are relative to the viewport's width or height. For example, setting a width of 50vw on an element will make it 50% of the viewport's width, regardless of the screen size. Viewport units are commonly used for creating fully responsive designs that adapt well to different screen sizes.


<h1>What is it ..?</h1>
<p>The full form of VW is viewport width. It works like the percentage unit.
     Specifying 10vw is equivalent to occupying 10% of entire visible screen width.</p>
     <p>The full form of VH is viewport height. It works like the percentage unit as well. 
        Specifying 10vh is equivalent to occupying 10% of entire visible screen height.</p>
